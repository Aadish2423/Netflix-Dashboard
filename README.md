# Netflix-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard analyzing Netflix viewing trends, genre popularity, user preferences, and subscription patterns using a synthetic dataset. Built to explore data storytelling, visualization, and analytical insights.

This project is a Power BI dashboard built using a synthetic Netflix dataset to showcase insights into user behavior, content trends, and subscription analytics. The goal was to simulate a real-world streaming platform dashboard, focusing on interactive visuals and meaningful metrics that could help Netflix (or any streaming service) make data-driven decisions.

🔍 Key Features:
User Viewing Patterns: Breakdown of viewership over time, top-watched content by genre, and heatmaps indicating peak activity hours.

Genre Analytics: Visualization of popular genres by total watch time and frequency across age groups and regions.

User Demographics: Charts showing age, region, and device usage patterns, helping understand Netflix's audience base.

Subscription Metrics: Monthly and yearly subscription trends with retention and churn estimates to simulate business performance.

Engagement KPIs: Metrics like average watch time per session, binge-watching trends, and most rewatched titles.

📂 Dataset:
A dummy dataset was created using realistic patterns in user activity, genre preferences, and subscription behavior. This was designed to resemble public Netflix datasets and extrapolated with additional attributes for deeper insights.

🎯 Purpose:
Learn Power BI storytelling and dashboarding

Apply data analysis techniques to entertainment data

Simulate executive-level reporting with interactive visuals
